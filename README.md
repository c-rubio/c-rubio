Hi, I’m christian!

I’m interested in machine learning, software engineering, Arduino programming, video games, and more!

I'm currently learning C++ and Data Structures in school, as well as researching IoT and federated learning with microcontrollers with the NC A&T ADEPT Lab. 

# PERSONAL PROJECTS
<br>

This is a continual WIP, and will be updated as time goes on. These are just some personal projects I've been working on.

Current posted projects are as follows: 

1. GPA Calculator
2. The OAAC (Object Avoiding Arduino Car)
<br>

  <p>
    This project is based upon calculating the different GPA's that NC A&T implements. These include the transcript, honors, and major GPA. It functions as a practice for coding standards and object-oriented programming. Persistent storage is utilized in a .csv format to reduce redundancy upon reusing the program. Future expected features include automatic major-related class detection.

<p align="left"> The <i><b/>"OAAC"</b></i> is a modest, ultrasonic sensor based object avoiding car. It functions as FWD, with wheels ran by continous servo motors. It runs a "smart" detection pattern to decide on which direction to move upon encountering an object. Future expected features include mitigating blind-spot complications and improved sensor sweeping. </p>
