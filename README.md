Hi, I’m christian!

I’m interested in machine learning, software engineering, Arduino programming, video games, and more!

I'm currently learning Java in my computer program design class, as well as researching IoT and federated learning with microcontrollers with the NC A&T ADEPT Lab.

Currently, this repository may be empty. However, it will be updated with projects as I leave classes or develop personal projects.
