Hi, I’m christian!

I’m interested in machine learning, software engineering, Arduino programming, video games, and more!

I'm currently learning C++ and Data Structures in school, as well as researching IoT and federated learning with microcontrollers with the NC A&T ADEPT Lab. 

# PERSONAL PROJECTS
<br>

This is a continual WIP, and will be updated as time goes on. These are just some personal projects I've been working on.

Projects are as follows: 

1. GPA Calculator
2. Object-Avoiding Arduino Car (to be added)

  <p>
    This project is based upon calculating the different GPA's that NC A&T implements. These include the transcript, honors, and major GPA. It functions as a practice for coding standards and object-oriented programming. It's still a work in progress, Since it functions at the moment, my next steps are continuing to improve code organization and readability.
