Hi, I’m christian!

I’m interested in machine learning, software engineering, Arduino programming, video games, and more!

I’m currently learning the basics of computer programming through python, but my interest was initially piqued working with Arduino's at NC A&T's ADEPT Lab. 
For the moment, this Github page is not developed, and is a work in progress as I add in my personal or class projects.
